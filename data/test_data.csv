understanding the basics and tools is only part of the battle a robust security
plan involves the strategy of searching for vulnerabilities addressing them
before any attackers do and planning for any interruptions to critical business
functions in this domain we will cover identifying vulnerabilities managing risk
and developing disaster recovery and business continuity plans vulnerability
management is an ongoing process in which organisations proactively identify
vulnerabilities document discovered vulnerabilities make decisions on how to
handle those vulnerabilities and what order implement responses to mitigate
the most important vulnerabilities and monitor how effective deploy responses
are managing vulnerabilities is always more effective and less costly than
dealing with the consequences of successful attacks the first step in
vulnerability management is to identify vulnerabilities that exist in an
environment the first step in vulnerability identification is to collect
comprehensive descriptive information about an environments hardware and
software components a comprehensive inventory is made up of descriptive
information for each component including detailed version information once a
comprehensive inventory has been compiled each component can be
compared against lists and databases of known vulnerabilities to identify
intersections that indicate a vulnerability exists for one or more deploy
components food fresh knows that good cybersecurity builds customer Trust
so their it organisation implemented a change control process that documents
all configuration changes to their it infrastructure they are confident that their
software and hardware Inventories stay up to date but they still scanned verify
periodically and stay current on the latest vulnerabilities the fact that a
vulnerability exists for a diploid component does not necessarily mean that an
attack is imminent for a vulnerability to be exploited there must be an external
threat that is realised against that specific vulnerability the main purpose of
vulnerability management is to reduce and organisations attack surface by
mitigating as many vulnerabilities as possible within budgetary constraints as
a result of organisations operating with limited budgets the best approach to
implementing vulnerability mitigations is to qualitatively and or quantitatively
assess the relative impact of each discovered vulnerability and apply budget
to vulnerabilities deemed most damaging once the organisation decides which
vulnerabilities will be mitigated the goal is to reduce the opportunity for an
attacker to successfully exploit a vulnerability and carry out an attack
mitigating a vulnerability does not always mean removing that vulnerability it
means to make it less dangerous to the organization the last step in
"
Page 2,"vulnerability management is to assess each mitigation to ensure that the
exposure to each vulnerability is less than it was before deploying mitigations
if you're mitigations are doing their job your organization's attack service
should be smaller at this point the process repeats itself and continually
results in finding new vulnerabilities and ways to mitigate them

attackers and cybersecurity professionals both use reconnaissance to gather
information about a target environment attackers use reconnaissance to
identify the weakest component or components in an environment in
cybersecurity professionals carry out the same tasks to identify vulnerabilities
before the attackers do there are two main types of reconnaissance that are
helpful to build a picture of a target environment passive reconnaissance is
the process of collecting information about a target environment without
interacting with that environment directly active reconnaissance collects
environmental information by interacting with the environment and analysing
responses knowing how to use active and passive reconnaissance prepares
an organisation to build a solid defense from cyber-attack in advantage of
passive reconnaissance is that information collection can occur in stealthy
manner the target environment is not alerted to passive reconnaissance
activities internet search engines and social media can be great sources of
information about any organisation or person it doesn't take long to collect
demographic and other descriptive information about a target the technique of
using an internet search engine to find detailed information about any entity is
a process called Google hacking Google hacking involves using specific
syntax and constructing Google or other search engine queries to return
information about online entities social media accounts for an organisation or
its personnel can also return valuable information job postings can also be
repositories of valuable environmental information for example if an
organisation is advertising for an Apache web server security specialist it
stands to reason that that organisation uses the Apache web server job
applicant requirements often divulge important environmental architectural
details other online resources for passive reconnaissance include sites that
published leaked passwords and strategic search engines such as showdown
or census open a web browser and navigate to https colon slash slash

another useful website for passive reconnaissance is the way back machine
which can be found at archive.org the way that machine stores archived
versions of websites some of which go back over 20 years you will not find
every website represented in this database but for those that do exist looking
at old versions of an organization's website can reveal lots of information
about that organisation open a web browser and navigate to https colon slash
slash archive.org type loki.com the results page shows how many times the
website learnt key.com has been captured you can select any date on the
calendar to see what the website look like on that day you can see this
website has been captured 826 times between November 9th 1996 through
March 18th 2022 let's select the year 2007 and pick any date on that calendar
look like in 2007 the way that machine can provide lots of information about
how companies have changed over time the other main approach to
reconnaissance is active reconnaissance when carrying out active
reconnaissance the goal is to communicate with the target environment to
determine what resources exist within a network and what those Resources
do one of the most common tools used for active reconnaissance is in map
the in map utility stands for network mapper and fulfills its name quite well
within map you can scan a network to find what nodes are active what ports
are open on each node and even make an educated guess as to what
operating system each node is running an initial in map scan is one that likely
just Returns active nodes and helps develop the high level view of a network
architecture the process of active reconnaissance used to map a network is
called enumeration at the windows powershell prompt type in map minus
capital a 10.0 / 24 and select the inner key on your keyboard the in map utility
will scan the 10.0.0 network and report on open ports possible operating
systems and any other service information it can find there are many other
tools available to help collect information from a network including tools like
who is netcat in Wireshark each one of these tools assists in collecting
information about a network environment by sending network traffic to Nodes
in the network and analysing the results active reconnaissance is generally
more accurate than passive reconnaissance but at the risk of the person
carrying out the reconnaissance being discovered most active reconnaissance
utilities generate traffic that network security devices can detect and potentially
classify as malicious activity in short if stealth is important use passive
reconnaissance first and then only use active techniques sparingly

the testing phase of vulnerability identification is really an extension of the
active reconnaissance phase testing or port scanning often uses many of the
same tools as those used in initial active reconnaissance the main difference
is in the intensity of the scan and the quantity of traffic sent to each node a
simple icmp packet sent to a suspected node may be sufficient to report that
the note is alive but to determine what ports are open and what services are
running on each port many more packets will be sent to the same node testing
through port scanning is an effective way to collect the same information about
your environment that attackers may try to use against you the inmate utility is
a favourite tool to use in Port scanning multiple tools are available that either
work in a similar fashion to in map or that provide a more user friendly front
end map for more sophisticated and unattended port scanning more
comprehensive packages such as nessus or openvas provide aggressive port
scanning and Environment analysis with user-friendly front ends the main goal
of the testing or port scanning phase is to collect as much information as
possible about the operating systems and services the target environments
nodes are running when an attacker or cybersecurity professional knows what
services are running on what nodes identifying which of those components are
most vulnerable becomes possible for example if a brand new vulnerability for
the Microsoft internet information services or II's web server is published and
attacker would want to know if that vulnerability might be an attack vector for
specific target if the testing phase reports that a target runs the Linux
operating system in the Apache web server no iis vulnerability would do the
attacker any good that's why learning as much as possible about each target
node helps choose the vulnerabilities that may be the way to compromise one
of those nodes

means that the common approach is to start with high level scans and then
create more detailed scans based on the information received in the previous
scan layer for example a first-level scan might include an operating system
fingerprint pass which means in attempt to determine the operating system for
each node taking the results of the phase one scan the next scan could
search for common ports that might be open based on the detected operating
system this approach requires many more scans and lots of repetitive activity
to increase consistency and reduce errors automation can help simplify
multiple layers of scans automation can be as simple as writing scripts that
call command line utilities or utilising more comprehensive scanners such as
nessus or open bass in automating their activities regardless of the nature of
the tools it is recommended to automate scans as much as possible to reduce
the workload in finding vulnerabilities

an important part of vulnerability management is determining what
vulnerabilities exist in the scope of an IT environment the standard approach
to discovering vulnerabilities is to compare current hardware and software
inventory with the repository of known vulnerabilities knowing how to use
vulnerability repositories and how to avoid their limitations helps avoid missing
important vulnerabilities there are multiple sources of vulnerability repositories
available both as lists and databases some repositories are publicly available
in others are available by subscription only regardless of the repositories you
may choose to use it is important that your inventory Express hardware and
software components in a way that you can query the repository for matching
vulnerabilities likewise you should use a standard vocabulary for describing
vulnerabilities their severity and possible mitigations open web browser and
navigate to https colon slash slash cve.mitre.org cde stands for common
vulnerabilities and exposures and it is a list of publicly disclosed security flaws
maintained by The Mitre organisation this is one of the most common
repositories of vulnerabilities that's published to the world select search cve

vulnerabilities that have been posted here let's select one and you can see a
description of a specific cve ID entry with a description of what the

reduce the time required to identify vulnerabilities but they're only useful if the
contents of the repository are current since new vulnerabilities are discovered
daily and out of date vulnerability repository may miss crucial vulnerabilities
that could allow an attacker to compromise your environment that's why it's
important to continually scan your networks for running services and compare
that result with online up-to-date vulnerability repositories to make sure you're
aware of every vulnerability that could impact your environment

the first step in crafting a penetration test cybersecurity attack or carrying out a
comprehensive vulnerability assessment is that enumeration phase
enumeration is developing the architectural detail plan of your target
environment the reason that enumeration is so important in the vulnerability
management process is because the whole purpose is to find what
vulnerabilities are known that affect the hardware and software components of
your network if your hardware and software asset list is incorrect or out of date
you're going to miss potentially harmful vulnerabilities in your it environment a
critical component of a comprehensive vulnerability management program is
ensuring that all documentation pertaining to your it environment is accurate
and up-to-date asset lists network Maps policies procedures in any other
documentation should be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect the
current state of your environment likewise documentation should be reviewed
whenever a security incident occurs and after the incident has been resolved
since the security incident can only occur when an attacker exploits a gap it is
important to address any gaps in document any changes that were made
assume that food fresh added a new web server to their environment to
handle new line of allergen free food products if administrators neglect to add
the new web server to the hardware and software asset list subsequent
vulnerability assessments will ignore the new web server and potentially miss
any vulnerabilities that are present while omitting a specific server or service
does not always lead to an attack it does open the door for potential
vulnerabilities to be found by an attacker if the system owner is not looking at
the resource themselves that is why a change management process is so
important to security keeping documentation up to date may not be easy but it
will make your it environment much more secure and more shorten the time
required to respond to incidents

you may have heard the term risk management and vulnerability management
used interchangeably in reality vulnerability management and risk
management are related but they are distinct activities understanding the
difference between a vulnerability and risk help security professionals develop
the most effective strategies to avoid cyber attack a vulnerability is any
Weakness in an environment that could allow an attacker to carry out a
successful attack to carry out a successful attack and attack her must carry
out and exploit against a vulnerability a risk is the likelihood that some action
may occur that has an effect on an organisation along with the magnitude of
the impact to that organisation in most cases and in our conversation of
cybersecurity We Will consider risk to refer to an adverse event regardless of
the approach used to assess risk the primary goal is to create a list of known
risks sorted by likelihood and effect on the organisation any action that
exploits a vulnerability successfully is referred to as a realised risk realise risk
always has an effect on the organisation and the ones that are most likely to
occur and had the highest negative impact are the ones that should be
addressed first one approach to mitigating risk is to mitigate the vulnerability
which could allow risk to be realised that's why vulnerability management and

there are two main approaches to assessing and managing risk qualitative
and quantitative it is important for security professionals to understand both
qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods and know when to use
each one to build an effective risk response plan qualitative risk assessment
assigns a subjective level of risk based on an individual risks likelihood of
occurrence and effect on the organisation each organisation can define its
own levels of risk the common risk levels include low medium high and
extremely high a risk that is likely to occur several times each year and will
result in a loss of several hundreds of thousands of Dollars with each
occurrence would likely be assigned a risk of high or extremely high on the
other hand a risk that is expected to only be realised once every 10 or 15
years with an expected loss of $500 per occurrence would be assigned a risk
level of low qualitative risk assessment is good for comparing the relative
importance of different risks but not comparing monetary impact quantitative
risk assessment assigns numbers that are easy to calculate and use in
"
Page 11,"formulas to determine expected loss each risk is a sign of probability of
occurrence and a Dollar value for the loss should that risk be realised the
Dollar value of the realised risk loss is easy to calculate by multiplying the
occurrence probability times the loss expectancy quantitative risk analysis
makes it easy to write risk by expected loss each year quantitative risk
assessment works very well when numbers are available and can be largely
automated however occurrence probabilities and expected loss numbers are
only estimates it is often the case that personnel who worked most closely
with the resources at risk may provide more valuable input to the risk
assessment process for this reason it's recommended to use both qualitative
and quantitative risk assessment and compare the results the best result of
each analysis type would be a list with the same risks ranked in the same
manner in practice the lists are likely to be slightly different and require
management to make decisions on how to allocate limited budgets for risk

breach identified risk their generally four mitigation options organisations can
choose any of the four depending on its applicability to a specific risk one way
to mitigate risk is avoidance any risk that can completely be avoided without
excessive costs should be avoided an example of avoidance can be disabling
or removing unneeded services for example if a database server has an old
insecure web server running on that same computer the unused web service
may be vulnerable to attack disabling the web service or completely
uninstalling the web service removes the vulnerability and any risk associated
with it another risk mitigation strategy is acceptance if the risk is realised and
causes very little negative impact to the organisation the best strategy may be
simply to accept the risk if trying to mitigate the risk using some other
technique would cost more than the loss that is expected then acceptance
may be the best choice any risk that cannot be accepted or avoided may best
be handled by being controlled controlling a risk means to deploy some
security control that reduces the probability that a risk will be exploited by a
successfully realised threat adding a firewall IDS or IP's or implementing nfa
or examples of deploying security controls as mitigation strategies and finally
the last risk mitigation strategy is to transfer the risk transferring a risk is the
result of an agreement that should a risk be realised the loss would be
covered by another party insurance is one of the most common risk
transference approaches think of your personal vehicle personal car insurance

data disclosure is a risk for data that should not be disclosed not all data that
information systems store or process should be protected from disclosure only
data that is marked as sensitive should be protected and controlled from
disclosure understanding how data classification affects security control needs
is important to building effective security common classes are protected data
include personally identifiable information or pii and personal health
information or Phi pii and Phi are common targets of standards and
regulations to ensure these types of data are protected pci-dss gdpr and hipa
are all standards and regulations that set requirements on how pii and Phi are
handled special classifications of certain types of data come with additional
risk for example disclosing consumer private information or pii for
organisations that are subject to gdpr may result in the risk of fine or loss of
privileges gdpr does not place the same level of restrictions on non-personal
data so in this way data classification should play into overall risk

chance of surviving an interruption rather than succumbing to it the difference
between a drp and a BCP has to do with severity in short a BCP addresses
short-term interruptions while a drp addresses severe damage to the
infrastructure that supports operations both drp and BCP focus on restoring
minimal business operations before an organisation can plan to continue or
restore operations they must have a clear understanding of what makes up
their operations a business impact analysis or BIA is a formal assessment of
business processes that are Critical to support normal operations a
comprehensive via defines all critical business functions or CBS that must be
protected to conduct operations the drp and BCP provide details on what it
takes to ensure that all CVs can operate a BCP is a plan that is activated

simple as a power outage or a malfunctioning hvac system which causes
workers to leave a facility a BCP often specifies alternate processing options
that allow CBS to continue with minimal interruption bcps often depend on
redundancy and alternate approaches to maintaining CBF continuity a drp
gets activated whenever an event has caused so much damage that the
infrastructure that supports operations can no longer function fires
earthquakes and other major events that cause structural damage are often
causes to activate a drp the drp specifies the steps necessary to take to
restore the infrastructure that operations needs to continue once the drp
satisfies its goals the BCP can continue to restart operations the two plans

losing critical operational data that may result in substantial monetary losses a
backup is simply a secondary copy of stored data to be used if the primary
copy becomes damaged or otherwise unusable historically most organisations
would create periodic backups to removable tape devices today backups may
use tapes but may also utilise removable disks optical disks network storage
or even virtualised images the primary goal of the backup is to copy important
data to an alternate source with the hopes of separating the backup from the
source of any damage that may occur to the primary copy since backups
should be separated from primary copies removable Media or network storage

that a catastrophic event will impact both the primary and secondary copies of
data for that reason off-site backups and alternate processing sites are

more than once a day and if it's more than once a day I can select what times
I want select next we then get to determine where we want to store the
backups once we determine where we tell Windows what disc we want to
back up to and finally we confirm the process this is how easy it is to set up a
new backup schedule you want to make sure you back up periodically add a
set schedule so that you always know you have a good secondary copy of
data available one of the most common flaws in a backup strategy is a clear
procedure for restoring backup data when needed restoring a backup image is
not always as easy as organisations may expect the process involves
acquiring the correct backup image determine what parts need to be restored
and then initiating the restore process all the steps depend on proper backup
handling labeling and scoping of the restore process without proper planning
and organisation may find themselves in a situation where restoring a
complete backup takes many more hours than expected to avoid surprises
after a catastrophic incident organisations must develop comprehensive
restore plans and then test them any untested recovery plan is in and of itself
a disaster waiting to happen

what are the primary tenets of cybersecurity is availability a disaster that
interrupts operations is in effect and attack on availability implementing
controls to reduce the risk of a disaster impacting operations is a crucial
aspect to maintaining availability although the focus of cybersecurity controls
is to protect against attack a disaster can be viewed as a specific category of
attack one of the first layers of disaster controls are preventative controls
preventive controls are controls that are designed to prevent and attack or
incident from occurring in the case of a fire using fireproof materials when
building a data center and prohibiting flammable contents or open flames

appropriate electrical circuits and periodically examining electrical cabling and
electrical connections can reduce or prevent fires Started From electrical
faults the next layer disaster controls are detective controls fires only one type
of disaster in which damage increases dramatically as the event persists early
detection of a fire is crucial to control damage and avoid a series incident from
becoming a full-fledged disaster fire detection devices such as smoke
detectors are a first line of Defense in fighting fires once a fire is detected the
next line of Defense is a corrective control fire extinguishers provide the ability
to respond or correct a fire that has been detected fire extinguishers exist in
different classes to be used for different types of fires comprehensive disaster
preparation should include all three types of controls for each identified
disaster threat
